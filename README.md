This project is produced in order to heal the wounds of the earthquake in Turkey.
But as in every earthquake, this earthquake offers us something.
The most important thing in an earthquake is to support and force the force.
Many teams and people from around the world helped us. We are trying to help people from all over the world by sharing this project as open source.

Earthquakes are everywhere. We are ready, for the whole world. All of our resources are open source and accessible.
